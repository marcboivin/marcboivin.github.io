[{"categories":null,"content":"I used to whip up Django anytime I needed a quick web app. Frontend has gotten messy and complex so I don’t enjoy using it as part of my “move fast, test things” workflow.\nGood thing APIs are most everywhere and JSON can be used as a backend frontend now. Everybody speaks JSON, you get pretty output everywhere, you can beautify it and put it in plain text, you can easily rework it by hand or by code and the files are relatively small (compared to your XML of old).\nI dabble a lot in data and data processing so I keep using Python when I need to publish a simple script or a simple web service in my dev cycle.\nFlask, SQLite and click I find using Flask keep things light, readable and fast to develop. You add click on top of it and you can get a super quick and nice script with arguments, feedback, interactions.\nSQLite as the data store make for a great application file format or it is also pretty SQL complete so no roadblocks here. Back in the days (2007) you could do SELECT and INSERT but the funkiest of the SQL commands where not supported.\nSo I don’t need to learn new tools and can build on top of this simple yet flexible foundation.\nCSV and Excel This is a cluster fuck. Dat science is telling me to setup pipelines and workflows with Airflow and Kafka but I find this very time consuming and since I don’t have a specific end goal I don’t feel like this is worth my time.\nI’m interested in querying CSV as SQL because that would streamline my process, but I didn’t find anything Python, able to handle millions of CSV lines AND accept JOIN statements.\nI’ll definitely csvsql a try, but my JOIN requirement tells me I should suck it up and make an import script into SQLite. We’ll see.\nAs I write this I see SQLite has a .import function for CSV. Maybe something to test.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Stack for Experiments","uri":"/post/stack-for-experiments/"},{"categories":null,"content":"Chasing the trend of trying to recapture what it was like to publish and do dev in the early 2000’s I’m giving Hugo a try.\nGitHub pages seems to be the perfect Geocities replacement and thus, this lives here.\nRight off the bat, things are different. Back in the days, you could conceivably open Notepad, or FrontPage and start building a page.\nBuilding in Hugo is not easier or different from any other moderns stack I know. Publishing seems a lot easier, mainly because there is no backend to worry about. Backend in the sense of a “dynamic backend” where a SQL database of some sort is involved.\nSo, took me about 5 hours of researching and testing things to get to place where I can publish. Didn’t hate the process, didn’t love it either.\nBeing able to write in VS Code or Notepad if I so choose is a nice touch. Being built on top of git is another one.\nMy current theme, Ed, is supposed to be geared towards publishing. Since I don’t intend to share much code here, I’m giving it a try.\nLet’s see if this stack makes me more likely to publish more and maybe even have something to say.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"A Static site, Hugo and Github","uri":"/post/hugo-github/"}]
